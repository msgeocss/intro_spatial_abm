Intro to creating spatial ABM with Netlogo and QGIS

This repo contains slides and a model with data that introduce users to spatial agent-based modeling using Netlogo with the GIS and CSV extensions. The slides are broken in to 7 parts and walk users through Netlogo basics, coding syntax familiarity, pros and cons of spatial ABM, Intro to data getting cleaning and processing, Intro to QGIS, and the creation of a spatial ABM. This content takes about 4 hours to get through at a comfortable pace. It can be covered in less time at a faster pace and skipping time to explore models. Note that these are only reference slides and model designed to introduce content and lingo for students so that they will then have a foundation to explore and learn more quickly on their own.

Coding, data, and modeling = fun!
